         <p>忍者刀 NINJATÔ</p>
         <p>The Ninjatô was made by the warrior or blacksmith himself, without much refinement, unlike the Katana, in which it was made by a craftsman hired by the Samurai. Therefore, these swords used by the Ninja were not always of good quality. This is due to several factors, such as purchasing power, anonymity and especially the feeling attributed to the sword. For a Samurai, the Katana was seen as part of their soul, a symbol of their caste. The Ninja, on the other hand, saw his sword, as well as other weapons used by him, as a work tool. These “weapons” are appropriately called 忍具 Ningu or Ninja tools, as for these warriors, their weapons must have multiple functions.</p>
         <p>手鉤 SHUKÔ</p>
         <p>Shukô can be classified in two ways: 隠し武器 Kakushi Buki (hidden weapons) and 忍具 Ningu (Ninja instruments/tools), exclusive to the Ryûha of Ninjutsu, was for a long time kept secret by these schools. It is a weapon similar to a cat's claw, made of metal and leather, used to climb over obstacles and effectively used in hand-to-hand combat or against weapons such as the Katana.</p>
         <p>距跋渉毛 KYOKETSU SHÔGE</p>
         <p>Little is known about this weapon known as Kyoketsu Shôge, also called 忍び分銅 Shinobi Bundo. As seen from historical perspective, the weapon is said to have emerged from the combination of a broken spear called 鎌槍 Kamayari and tied to a 縄 Nawa rope. Originally this rope was made from animal hair or fur (such as horse hair). An iron hoop was attached to the free end of this rope, its shape and size could vary.</p>
